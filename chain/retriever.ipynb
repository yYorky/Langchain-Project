The story and gameplay will be the same but \\nthere will be a lot of added content. There are a t otal of 386 Pokemon in this \\ngame, all are actually catchable in this ONE game, no trading is necessary.  \\n     This guide will contain notes from the hacker who created the ROM and \\nwill give you all the inside tips on where to catch  every single Pokemon and \\nall the other fun additions to the original game. \\nSo without further ado, let’s catch ‘em all!  \\nUsing This Guide  \\nThis guide has three major parts: \\nGame Intro  \\n      The first section covers all the basics and i mportant \\nstuff you need to know before you start the game.  The Index  \\n     Filled with tables, the Index is where you go to find \\nlocations on everything in the game, from items to  \\nThe Walkthrough  \\n     The main section packed with maps and info tel ls \\nyou how to find all the secrets in the game and \\ncomplete it 100%. TMs to Pokemon. You can also get a short descriptio n \\nof what each item does or what each TM contains. \\nThere is no huge Pokedex though, the Index is only for \\nfinding the locations of Pokemon. \\nBattleing and Type Matchups!!!  \\n     There are 17 types of Pokemon, with many who b elong to two type. Each type of Pokemon has strengt hs and \\nweaknesses versus other types, with appropriate dam age multipliers applied accordingly. Thus succeedin g in battle \\ncomes down to matching Pokemon type for type. The w ell-balanced party has enough Pokemon straddling ea ch \\ncategory that you always have some Pokemon capable of causing your opponent devastating damage. \\n     The following table shows how the various matc hes shake out. Damage can go as high as 4x if a Pok emon is \\ncomprised of two-classes that would each normally t ake 2x damage from a specific type.  \\nNormal Fire Water Grass Electric Ice Fighting Poison Ground Flying Psychic Bug Rock Ghost Dragon Dark Steel \\nNormal x0.5 x0 x0.5 \\nFire x0.5 x0.5 x2 x2 x2 x0.5 x0.5 x2 \\nWater x2 x0.5 x0.5 x2 x2 x0.5 \\nGrass x0.5 x2 x0.5 x0.5 x2 x0.5 x2 x0.5 x0.5 \\nElectric x2 x0.5 x0.5 x0 x2 x0.5 \\nIce x0.5 x0.5 x2 x0.5 x2 x2 x2 x0.5 \\nFighting x2 x2 x0.5 x0.5 x0.5 x0.5 x2 x0 x2 x2 \\nPoison x2 x0.5 x0.5 x0.5 x0.5 x0 \\nGround x2 x0.5 x2 x2 x0 x0.5 x2 x2 \\nFlying x2 x0.5 x2 x2 x0.5 x0.5 \\nPsychic x2 x2 x0.5 x0 x0.5 \\nBug x0.5 x2 x0.5 x0.5 x0.5 x2 x0.5 x2 x0.5 \\nRock x2 x2 x0.5 x0.5 x2 x2 x0.5 \\nGhost x0 x2 x2 x0.5 x0.5 \\nDragon x0.5 x2 x0.5 \\nDark x2 x2 x0.5 x0.5 \\nSteel x0.5 x2 x2 x2 x0.5  \\nMove is the same type as Pokemon  x1.5  \\nMove is effective ag ainst opponent’s Pokemon  x2 -4 \\nMove scores a Critica l Hit!  x2  \\nPokemon has an Item that raises the Move’s strength  x1.1  \\nStage condition effects move  x1.5 or x0.5  \\n', metadata={'source': 'Pokemon-ultra-violet-guide.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Catch ‘em all!  \\nIf there is an overriding reason for many people to  play the Pokemon games, it is simply to collect ea ch and every \\ncreatur in the game. There are several ways to find  them all. (not all of them are listed here) \\nWild Encounters  \\n     The first, and most common, way you will find Pokemon is \\nin wild Pokemon  battles. Simply walk out into the grass or \\ninto a cave and it won’t be long till a wild Pokemo n jumps out \\nfrom its hiding spot for a battle.    \\n     Then you can begin the process of catching thi s wild \\nPokemon and adding it’s data to your Pokedex.   \\n \\n Fishing   \\n     Though you won’t be able to do it until you ha ve \\ngotten a fishing rod, fishing is a great way to cat ch \\nthose elusive, Water-type Pokemon.  \\n     To fish, all you need is a rod and some water.  Simply \\nwalk up to a shore, river, or lake and use the rod of your \\nchoice, once you get a “bite”, you are launched int o \\nbattle against whatever Pokemon was on your hook. \\nSurfing  \\n     To catch Pokemon while surfing, you first need  to acquire \\nthe HM03 SURF, After you do this, you just need a c ompatible \\nWater-type Pokemon to teach the move to. Then, once  \\nyou’ve taken to the sea on its back, it’s precisely  the same as \\nwalking in a cave or through grass… only Water-type  \\nPokemon pop out. \\n \\n Evolution  \\n     Most Pokemon have at least one other form they  \\nturn into after they’ve gained sufficient experienc e. This \\nis the easiest way to add Pokemon to your Pokedex, \\nand you’ll probably be surprised at how quickly you r \\ncollection begins to grow after a few Pokemon start  \\nchanging into their more power forms. There are \\nmultiple ways to evolve Pokemon, some evolve at \\ncertain levels, while others use items or some othe r \\ntype of thing to trigger evolution. \\nThe Business of Catching Pokemon…   \\n     There is only one way to catch a wild Pokemon,  and that is via the use of a PokeBall. PokeBalls c ome in various types, \\neach with is specific traits. The PokeMarts scatter ed throughout the land sell many types of PokeBalls . The majority of \\nthem being; standard PokeBalls, GreatBalls, and Ult raBalls. Each is slightly more expensive than the p revious and slightly \\nmore efficient.  \\n     That being said, luck plays a very large part in how effective a PokeBall  can be in a given situ ation. While you might \\nsurmise that UltraBalls are the best in every situa tion, it isn’t always so. Your best bet is to learn  through \\nexperimentation which works best for you. After all , ther is no need to lay down the big bucks for Ult ra Balls if a regular \\nold PokeBall will work fine. \\n     In addition to these three kinds of PokeBalls,  there are many more kinds you will run into during  your adventure. You \\ncan find info about them in the Index or in the gam e itself after you have picked up these balls. \\n', metadata={'source': 'Pokemon-ultra-violet-guide.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Trading  \\n     Trading is not as important in Pokemon – Ultra Violet Version but in game trades are still mandatory to catch the m all. \\nWhile in Pokemon – Fire Red Version  some Pokemon required trading to evolve, that is n ot so in this game. You can \\ncatch and evolve EVERY Pokemon in the game without trading for any from another game.  \\nWelcome to the world of Pokemon!    \\n     Now you know everything you need to know befor e you start playing. So its officially time to hop in a comfy chair and \\nbegin your adventure into the world of Pokemon. \\nTo understand some of the overworld maps in this pl ayers guide, you will need to know some key symbols : \\n This star represents a special spot on the ground. When you st ep on this spot the next Pokemon you see will \\nbe a Shiny Pokemon (A Pokemon of an alternate color ). \\n This exclamation point represents a hidden item on the ground. Some of these items can be picked up by  \\nsimply pressing (A) on that spot while others requi re the Item-Finder to be used. \\n1 2 3 Big bold numbers represent an event that will be de tailed in the guide surrounding that map.  (Numbers may \\nvary in color depending on background) \\nA B C  Big bold letters represent a door,  ladder , or warp point , follow these letters from map to map, [A] will take \\nyou from one map to [A] on another map [B] goes to [B] and so on.
